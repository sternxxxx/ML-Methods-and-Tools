    "In this second part of the Notebook, we will focus on Word Embedding, which is a powerful way to associate a vector with a word. \"Word Embeddings\" are low-dimensional floating point vectors (i.e. \"dense\" vectors, as opposed to sparse vectors). It is common to see word embeddings that are 256-dimensional, 512-dimensional, or 1024-dimensional when dealing with very large vocabularies.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to obtain word embeddings:\n",
    "- Learn word embeddings jointly with the main task you care about (e.g. document classification or sentiment prediction). In this setup, you would start with random word vectors, then learn your word vectors in the same way that you learn the weights of a neural network.\n",
    "- Load into your model word embeddings that were pre-computed using a different machine learning task than the one you are trying to solve. These are called \"pre-trained word embeddings\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Word Embedding with the `Embedding` layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to associate a dense vector to a word would be to pick the vector at random. The problem with this approach is that the resulting embedding space would have no structure: for instance, the words \"accurate\" and \"exact\" may end up with completely different embeddings, even though they are interchangeable in most sentences. It would be very difficult for a deep neural network to make sense of such a noisy, unstructured embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world word embedding spaces, common examples of meaningful geometric transformations are \"gender vectors\" and \"plural vector\". For instance, by adding a \"female vector\" to the vector \"king\", one obtain the vector \"queen\". By adding a \"plural vector\", one obtain \"kings\". Word embedding spaces typically feature thousands of such interpretable and potentially useful vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "But more pragmatically, what makes a good word embedding space depends heavily on your task: the perfect word embedding space for an English-language movie review sentiment analysis model may look very different from the perfect embedding space for an English-language legal document classification model, because the importance of certain semantic relationships varies from task to task.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is thus reasonable to learn a new embedding space with every new task. Thankfully, backpropagation makes this really easy, and Keras makes it even easier. It's just about learning the weights of a layer: the Embedding layer."

    "The Embedding layer takes as input a 2D tensor of integers, of shape (samples, sequence_length), where each entry is a sequence of integers. It can embed sequences of variable lengths, so for instance we could feed into our embedding layer above batches that could have shapes (32, 10) (batch of 32 sequences of length 10) or (64, 15) (batch of 64 sequences of length 15). All sequences in a batch must have the same length, though (since we need to pack them into a single tensor), so sequences that are shorter than others should be padded with zeros, and sequences that are longer should be truncated.\n",
